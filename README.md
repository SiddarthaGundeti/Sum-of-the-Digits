# Sum-of-the-Digits

write a Python program that prints the sum of the digits o a given three-digit number.

Input: 326

Output: 11

Step 1: Read the number
First, we need to read the three-digit number from the user. We'll use the input() function to get the number as a string.

Step 2: Get individual digits
Now, we'll extract each digit from the given number. Since word is a string, we can access its characters using their positions (starting from 0). We'll convert these characters to integers using the int() function.

Step 3: Add the digits
Next, we'll add the three digits we extracted earlier.

Step 4: Display the result
Finally, we'll print the sum of the digits using the print() function.
